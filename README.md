# LaTeX Article CI/CD Template

## Introduction

This project provides a template repository for automatically compiling a LaTeX article with a bibliography using GitHub Actions. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the benefits of automation in Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD), ensuring that your LaTeX documents are consistently compiled with all references and citations correctly resolved. 
This setup enhances productivity and ensures high-quality document preparation.

## Setup Instructions

To set up this exercise, follow these steps:

1. **Use the Template Repository**:
   - Go to the LaTeX Article CI/CD Template Repository: [latex-article-template](https://github.com/matteodelucchi/latex-article-template).
   - Click on the "Use this template" button to create your own repository from this template.

2. **Clone Your Repository**:
   - Clone your repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
     cd your-repo-name
     ```

## Exercise Instructions

By completing the following tasks, you will gain practical experience in setting up and managing CI/CD workflows for LaTeX projects, enhancing your understanding of automation and its benefits.

1. **Make a Change in `main.tex`**:
   - Edit the `main.tex` file (on the `main` branch) to add or modify some content (e.g. add your name as author).
   - Commit and push your changes:
   - Check the CI/CD pipeline status on GitHub and get an overview of the pipeline execution:
        - How many workflows are triggered?  
        **Solution**: Only one workflow is triggered.
        - How many jobs are executed in each workflow?  
         **Solution**: Only one job is executed with four steps.
        - Which branch triggered the last pipeline run?  
         **Solution**: The main branch triggered the last pipeline run.
        - On which branch do the workflows run by default?  
         Solu**tion: The workflows run by default on any branch and is triggered by any push event.
        - How long does the pipeline take to complete?  
         **Solution**: The pipeline takes around 7 minutes to complete.
        - What is an artifact?  
         **Solution**: An artifact is a file or collection of files produced by a workflow run. Artifacts are associated with a workflow run and can be used to persist data or pass data between jobs in the same workflow. Here the artifact is the PDF file generated by the LaTeX compilation process.

2. **Modify the Workflow to Run Only on the Main Branch**:
   - Edit the `.github/workflows/latexBuild.yml` file to ensure the workflow runs only on the `main` branch.
   - Push a change to a different branch and observe if the workflow is triggered. What do you observe?

3. **Use an Action to Speed Up the Compilation Process**:
   - Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) and search for an action that can compile LaTeX documents (hint: use `texlive` as a keyword).
   - Modify the workflow to use an action to speed up the LaTeX compilation process.
   - Observe the pipeline run time before and after adding the caching action. What do you observe and why?

4. **Add a Second Workflow Using the TeX Live Docker Image**:
   - Create a new workflow file `.github/workflows/latex-docker.yml` that uses the [TeX Live Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/texlive/texlive) to compile the document.
   - Ensure this workflow runs on every push to the `main` branch.
   - Observe the differences in the pipeline execution and environment setup. What do you observe?

## Bonus Exercise

5. **Modify the `latex-docker` Workflow to Print the Artifact Link in the Pull Request**:
   - Edit the `.github/workflows/latex-docker.yml` file to include a step that prints the link to the PDF artifact in the pull request.
   - You can use the `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/github-script` actions to achieve this.
   - Create a pull request and observe the comments. What do you observe?
